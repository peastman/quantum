How To Be Less Confused About Quantum Mechanics
===============================================

This is a book for physicists and students of physics.  It does not try to teach you quantum mechanics.  I assume you
have already studied it, or perhaps you are currently taking your first course on the subject.  I also assume you are
confused.  This is a very safe assumption, because everyone who has studied quantum mechanics is confused, myself included.

The goal of this book is to help you become less confused.
